// ===================== PLAYER OF THE MONTH =====================
// Money Padel recommends candidates; the group chooses the winner.
//
// This is NOT a leaderboard and there is no Player of the Month score. A month
// can be won in different ways, so the recommendation looks for strong CASES
// of different kinds, each read from the month alone:
//
//   The month's competitions   who won a tier of the League, Merit or the
//                              Monthly Race -- the competitions' own results,
//                              handed in, never worked out here
//   Overperformer              highest average performance against expectation
//   Biggest Improver           most Power Rating gained through play
//   Strongest Results          best win rate
//   Upset Specialist           most wins as the underdog
//   Most Consistent            beat expectation in the largest share of matches
//   Most Active                most matches
//
// A competition winner is a candidate. So is whoever leads a statistical
// story; players level on it are all candidates (no tie-break is invented to
// separate them). Each statistical story has a floor below which it is not a
// case (a best win rate of 40% is not "Strongest Results"), and upsets count
// only in a month that was at or above expectation overall. Match count only
// ever earns "Most Active", so volume cannot win the month on its own. When
// fewer than three players are named, the next-best player on each statistical
// story is added until there are three. Nobody is cut to keep the list short:
// Admin trims it.
//
// Winning a competition is a strong reason, never the award: the group still
// votes.
//
// How a card reads. Each reason is a label and one sentence about what the
// player did ("Beat expectations by +7.2pp on average.") -- never a comparison
// with everyone else. Two or three competition wins are told once ("Triple
// Crown: won the League, Merit and the Monthly Race in Tier B") rather than as
// three near-identical lines. A card shows its strongest three reasons, in
// the fixed order of REASON_ORDER; anything else is listed by name only.
//
// Candidates are listed by name: the shortlist is the strongest cases, not a
// ranking. A player must have played MIN_MATCHES matches that month to be
// considered (Shaun, 4 Oct: the same 5 as the Monthly Performance podium and
// the Monthly Race).
//
// The second half of this module is the award record. A recommendation is
// recalculated whenever it is asked for; a finalised shortlist and a confirmed
// winner are SNAPSHOTS -- names, tiers, reasons and figures as they stood --
// so a confirmed award never changes when ratings, tiers, a player's status or
// these rules do.
//
// Pure: no page, no app state, no storage.
