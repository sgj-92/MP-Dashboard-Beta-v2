// ===================== GAMES FILTER =====================
// Which games a set of filters leaves, and one player's record over them.
//
// These are facts, not presentation, so they live here rather than inside the
// screen that happens to show them. Any screen that lists filtered games -- the
// Games log today, a redesigned Play › Results tomorrow -- asks this module and
// draws what it returns. Two screens that each filtered and tallied for
// themselves would eventually disagree about the same games.
//
// PURE. It reads nothing global: the match list, the classifier, the id
// mapping and the three helper modules it leans on are all passed in (the
// helpers default to the page's globals in the browser and to require() in
// Node). It writes nothing and never touches the DOM.
//
// Two rules carried over unchanged from the Games screen that used to hold
// this logic:
//   - every filter layers, and the game-type options offered are built from
//     what survives the OTHER filters (month and players), so the control
//     never offers a type that would show nothing; a selected type that no
//     longer exists under them falls back to 'all' BEFORE filtering;
//   - the record is counted from exactly the games returned, so P is the
//     number of rows a screen lists by construction, and W + D + L = P.
