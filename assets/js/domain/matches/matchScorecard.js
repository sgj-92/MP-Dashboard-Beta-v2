// ===================== MATCH SCORECARD =====================
// One completed match, as one canonical card: who played, in which tier ON THE
// DAY, the score, who won, what each side was expected to take, what it took,
// the difference, and how far every player's rating moved.
//
// It calculates nothing the engine did not. Every rating figure is read back
// from what the engine recorded when it rated the match (MatchFacts, built from
// the Rating Journey's MATCH_UPDATE events):
//
//   expected    the side's preMatchExpectedScore
//   actual      the side's actualScore -- the engine's own "actual", which is a
//               PERFORMANCE score (0.80 x share of games + 0.20 x the result),
//               not a share of games. The share of games is carried beside it
//               as labelled context, never in its place.
//   vs expected actual - expected, in percentage points. The engine stored the
//               difference itself (performanceResidual); it is what K
//               multiplies, so it is also why the ratings moved.
//   movement    each player's stored ratingDelta (K is per player, so the four
//               players move by four different amounts)
//   tier        each player's tierAtEvent, written on the same event
//
// Because all of it was written when the match was rated, none of it moves when
// a rating or tier moves later: a June scorecard reads the same in December.
// A match the engine has no record for (not yet rated) gets a card that says
// so -- its rating figures are absent, never estimated.
//
// Two views are drawn from that ONE view model, never from a second source:
//
//   build(...)       the full scorecard -- the Match Analysis: both teams'
//                    expected / actual / difference, game share, and every
//                    player's movement, winners and losers alike.
//   resultCard(vm)   the Match Result Card -- the celebratory, shareable face
//                    of the same match: the winners as the heroes, the score,
//                    one story, one expected-vs-performance line, and the
//                    winners' rating gains. Every number on it is a field of
//                    the scorecard, copied, not recalculated.
//
// The story is chosen by fixed thresholds on recorded figures (STORY below),
// so the same match always tells the same story -- no generated commentary.
//
// PURE. Inputs are passed in; it reads nothing global, writes nothing, touches
// no DOM. The on-screen sheet and the shared picture (CardPainter) both draw
// these view models.
