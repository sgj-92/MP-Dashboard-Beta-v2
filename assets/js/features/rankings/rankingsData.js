// ===================== RANKINGS: ELIGIBILITY, PODIUM AND KINGS (DATA) =====================
// Who is eligible for a rank (the same rule as playerStateOf), and who sits on
// the podium and on each tier's throne for the Rankings scope (tierInScope).
// Competition facts: functional code. The drawing is rankingsChrome.js.
//
// Extracted from shell.js unchanged (docs/architecture/PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_SPLIT.md).
// Owning stream: functional. Loads before app.js; declarations only.

// ---- Ranking eligibility (All-Time only) ---------------------------------
// The group's own existing standard -- play at least 2 games to stay "in
// the group" -- wasn't actually enforced anywhere before; some genuinely
// inactive players just never got their manual active flag updated. This
// makes it automatic: computed fresh from real match dates every time,
// nobody has to remember to flag anyone, and returning is as simple as
// playing again. Applies only to the All-Time Power Rankings list -- a
// monthly leaderboard already has its own natural eligibility test
// (you have to have played in that month to appear in it at all).
// Kept as names because several call sites read better with them, but the rule
// itself now lives in PlayerState -- one definition, one dataset, every surface.

// "Does this player get a rank number right now?" An INACTIVE player does not,
// and neither does an idle one -- but for different reasons, which is why the
// callers that need to tell them apart ask playerStateOf() instead.

// ---- The ranked pool for a scope ----------------------------------------
// Who the podium and Kings of Tiers rank, and in what order, for one scope
// ('all' or a 'YYYY-MM') and qualifying threshold -- the same filter sequence
// as the list beneath them (month merge, then min-games, then a month-end
// rating in a month view, or All-Time eligibility). Each row carries the
// rating and tier FOR THAT SCOPE: the month-end rating and the tier held at
// that month's close, never today's. Highest rating first. The Rankings
// screen asks for its own month; the Admin Board Pack asks for any month.

// ---- Rankings podium -----------------------------------------------------

// search, or a non-default min-games threshold. Replicates render()'s own
// filter sequence exactly (tier -> month merge -> min-games) and the fixed
// rating sort, so the podium can never disagree with the list beneath it.

// ---- Kings of Tiers -------------------------------------------------------
// Three kings of their own divisions (Tier A/B/C), not 1st/2nd/3rd overall --
// deliberately a separate concept from the podium above, which is the top 3
// of whichever tier/month scope is currently selected. Reuses exactly the
// same ranking data and the same gating rules as the podium (rating mode,
// no active search, min-games still at its scope's own default) so the two
// can never disagree, plus one extra rule of its own: only makes sense
// when every tier is on screen at once (activeTier === 'All'), since
// filtering to a single tier already answers "who's #1 here".
