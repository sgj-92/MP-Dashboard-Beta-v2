// ===================== RANKINGS: MONTHLY TABLE INPUTS =====================
// What the League, Last 10, Merit and Monthly Race tables are built from, and
// the order their standings are listed in: the canonical match sets handed to
// LastTen.build / MeritTable.build / MonthlyRace.build, and the League and
// Last 10 tie-break rules. Competition facts, so functional code -- a
// redesigned table consumes these and never re-derives them.
//
// Extracted from app.js unchanged (docs/architecture/PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_SPLIT.md).
// Owning stream: functional. Loads before app.js; declarations only.

// Every appearance in the record, as LastTen wants them: one entry per player
// per match. Built from the same two sources the monthly aggregation uses --
// ALL_MATCHES/MATCHES for rated results and getAllApprovedMatches() for draws
// -- so the two tables can never disagree about what a game was.
