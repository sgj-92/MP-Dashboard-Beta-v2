// ===================== DOUGHNUTS: THE DEFINITION =====================
// doughnutMatches(month) is THE doughnut definition (D7): every match, decided
// or drawn, with a set that finished with a side on 0. The By Player totals
// and the Doughnut List both read it.
//
// Extracted from shell.js unchanged (docs/architecture/PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_SPLIT.md).
// Owning stream: functional. Loads before app.js; declarations only.

// Reuses the same nearest-average pairing approach as the existing Find a
// Game engine (generateCandidatePairs/generateCandidatePartners) and the
// same Elo expected-score formula already used elsewhere in the app for
// predicted outcomes -- just orchestrated for "best partner + best opposing
// pair for that team", which the existing functions don't directly return.
// Doughnut leaderboard -- who's dished out and copped a 6-0 (or similar
// shutout set), all-time. Extends the existing "doughnuts received" concept
// already used in the monthly Summary (a set lost 0-x) with its natural
// missing other half, "doughnuts given" -- same underlying match data and
// the same per-set shutout check, just crediting the opposite side too.
// THE doughnut definition, once: every match -- decided or drawn -- with at
// least one set that finished with a side on 0, and in which direction. Both
// Doughnuts views read it: By Player aggregates it, the Doughnut List shows it
// as it is. `month` is 'YYYY-MM' or 'all'.

    // deduped so a match with two 6-0 sets the same way still counts once per
    // player per category (same total-count logic as before, just also keeping
    // the match reference now).
